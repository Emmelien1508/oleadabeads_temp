## Week 1: what have I done?
I have thought of a concept, and created a design document where I added designs of the pages that will be visible in the webshop. Then I added all url paths in urls.py and the functions in views.py, which I planned to work on further. 
### What went well?
The concept was well thought out, I knew exactly what pages I wanted on my website and how I wanted it to look.
### What did not go as plannend?
After thinking about all the relationships between the models, I thought of more while creating the functions in views.py. I noticed that the Many to Many relationship works differently than the others, which is something I have to get used to. Moreover when testing new changes, I encounter some errors which I have never seen, and Googling them doens't seem to yield any answers. To solve this I have to ask a TA or ask my question on ED.

## Week 2: what have I done?
I have defined the basic structures and pages of my webapplication. I have started to fill in the HTML pages with content.
### What went well?
My understanding of the relationships objects can have with each other grew. I have watched lots of videos and read documentation about the subject to get a better understanding of it.
### What did not go as plannend?
Due to my "aha"-moment about the objects in my database, I decided to change my database design. As a result, I had to delete my migrations folder and had to apply makemigrations again, which led to my data and superuser account to be reset. I had filled up my database with several objects, which were deleted in the redoing of the migrations.

## Week 3: what have I done?
I have filled up my database even more with up-to-date products and added nice pictures as well. In general, I was dotting the I's.
### What went well?
When I could add pictures, I could start making the pages look "pretty". That went very well and I am very happy with the results!
### What did not go as planned?
I was struggling with finding the path to the images so that I could display them on my pages. This took me a half a day to finally find the correct path. Moreover, I wanted to let the user be able to click on the next picture on the single product display page. However, because I was running out of time I didn't have enough time to figure this out. Eventually I did not have the time to add all specifications of my original idea about the webshop, like filtering or sorting the products.
