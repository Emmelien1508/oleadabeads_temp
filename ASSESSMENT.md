# What to pay extra attention to while grading

## Code
The code in views.py is a bit messy, with a couple of recurring lines of code. However, even though the code could be cleaned up a bit, it is well thought-out code that links all the different objects to one another in different ways. I have learned a lot from past assignments and I wanted to build on that even more with this one. I understand the different types of relationships better and the way a user communicates with the server, which is noteworthy and hopefully you see in the code.

## Interaction design
The website is, in my opinion, quite user friendly. It looks very clean, tight and well-arranged. The way certain tabs are at specific spots on the screen just make sense. The whole checkout process is clear, and the way the user receives an e-mail is a logical aspect of an online webshop. 

## Repository
The repository is neat and clean. Images are saved in a folder so that the server doesn't take a while to load everything. Images, static files and other files are stored in logical places and/or folders.

## Project documentation 
The screencast is the most prominent item in the repository, as it is the first thing you see when you open my Github file. I explain in detail how the webapplication works. Moreover, my design and readme document are also quite detailed. I believe my vision for the website is delivered accurately.
